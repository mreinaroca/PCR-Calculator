## PCR Calculator
In this project, I propose a easy-to-use PCR calculator. As a scientist, I have found it extremely useful to avoid tedious computations. Hopefully it does the same for you!

For non-programmers, go to src > ``InterfazPCR.java`` and hit run. You may configure the desired concentrations in the file `PCR_Calculator.java`

UI is still under development
